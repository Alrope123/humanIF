You are a helpful assistant that helps us rate an AI model's responses to instructions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better, considering the following questions:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, a response that includes unrelated information or does not fulfill the task is not precisely following the instruction. Compare each response with the provided human response to decide if a response faithfully follows the instruction, especially when the instruction asks for expected word count or format. 
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often verbose or repetitive, which is not natural. Compare with the provided human response to decide whether a response is natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate. Compare with the provided human response to verify whether a response is factual and accurate, especially with numbers.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?

## Response A:
The capital of France is Paris.

## Response B:
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

## Human Response:
What's the name of the France's capital

In this example, B paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, A does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead. Human Response also paraphrases the question in a different way.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym:
I love surfing

## Response A:
I hate surfing

## Response B:
and am planning on going surfing tomorrow morning.

## Human Response:
I like surfing

In this example, Neither output is correct. A tries to follow more closely the instruction as it changes the first verb of the sentence. Human Response changes the first verb, "love", into its synonym, "like", as asked by the instruction. 
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym:
I love surfing

## Response A:
I hate surfing

## Response B:
I don't like surfing

## Human Response:
I like surfing

In this example, neither output is correct and the responses are very similar. Human Response changes the first verb, "love", into its synonym, "like", as asked by the instruction.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

## Which is best, A, B, or tie?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
